## Key Principles
1. **Data Sovereignty**: All data remains within EU jurisdiction
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, NIS2, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)
3. **Open Standards**: Based on open-source technologies and standards
4. **Interoperability**: Federation across EU member states
5. **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture
6. **Vendor Independence**: No lock-in to non-EU providers
7. **Transparency**: Open governance and audit trails

## Core Components
- **Compute Layer**: Sovereign compute resources
- **Storage Layer**: Distributed, encrypted storage
- **Network Layer**: Secure, isolated networking
- **Identity & Access**: EU-based IAM with federation
- **Data Services**: Databases, analytics, AI/ML platforms
- **Security Services**: Encryption, monitoring, compliance
- **Management Plane**: Multi-tenant orchestration

## Compliance Framework
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security)
- DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
- eIDAS (Electronic Identification and Trust Services)
- Cybersecurity Act
- Data Governance Act
